# Goffeine

## About
Goffeine is a simple caffeine tracking tool.
It allows you to add your caffeine consumption in natural language. 

The half-life of caffeine is set to 5 hours and caffeine intake that's more than 24 hours in the past is ignored.
This is set according to [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/#:~:text=The%20mean%20half%2Dlife%20of,et%20al.%2C%201989)
I picked because it's been the very first result of my minimal effort google search.
